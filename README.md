# Simple Chat Room

This is a simple server/client chat room created in C# using the WebSocketSharp library.  This application was created for a networks course
at Kansas State University.  This repository contains two projects.  Part 1 consists of one chat server that multiple clients can connect
to.  Part 2 consists of multiple chat room servers that clients can connect to through a chat room directory.  Read the READMEs from Part 1
and Part 2, respectively, to learn more.
